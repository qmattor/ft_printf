Meta:
    I haven't really kept a log like this before, but I thought it might help
me keep my thoughts between my coding sessions, as well as give insight into
why I made certian choices in my coding.

Day 1:
    I already made a good portion of this project, having completed a
incomplete version. What is currently implemented is effectively a complicated
switch statement. I need to implement the modifiers and I'm currently thinking
that the best way to implement them is to pass them onto the write subroutines
as they are mostly pretty specific to the specifier, and the information will
be best utilized.
